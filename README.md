## Arguments

`-method`: HTTP method GET or POST

`-url`: URL string

`-threads`: Number of threads to run. Default value is 1 

`-resCode`: Response Code to check n Response for assertion. Run would pass if in response same code is returned. Default value is 200.

```javascript
{
  id:${id},
  value:"data_"${id}
}
```

## Syntax


```bash
  For Windows:

 #   cli_apithreads.exe -method <POST or GET> -url <URL> -threads <Number of threads> -resCode <Expected response code for assertion> -headers <filepath headers> -body <filepath body> -delay <Delay Seconds>
  
  For Mac/Linux:
  
 #   python cli_apithreads.pyc -method <POST or GET> -url <URL> -threads <Number of threads> -resCode <Expected response code for assertion> -headers <filepath headers> -body <filepath body> -delay <Delay Seconds>
```
## Demo

```bash
GET method:

Windows

# cli_apithreads.exe -method GET -url https://api.github.com/users/gaurangbhatt19 -threads 4 -resCode 200 -headers /headers.json

Mac/Linux
